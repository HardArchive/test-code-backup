This demo code is released to the public domain.
I release it this way so that the code can benefit everyone. (I don't make the
article itself public domain because having the article available only on
CodeProject helps both my own visibility and the CodeProject site.)
If you use this demo code in your own application, an email letting me know
would be appreciated (just to satisfy my curiosity about whether folks are
benefitting from my code) but is not required. Attribution in your own source
code is also appreciated but not required.

If you have other questions about using this code in your own work, see the
CodeProject FAQ at:
  http://www.codeproject.com/info/faq.asp
specifically question 4 in the section "Articles".
