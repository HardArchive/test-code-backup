detail: http://damody.pixnet.net/blog/post/29835522

just prebuilt, Code license as same as original code. update on 2013/5/18

vc11 only has x64 version

vc11up2 => msvc-11.0 update 2 version

so many open source library can't easily to build, I think we need library's prebuilt.

Now, just for VS2010 and VS2008. Each library have auto_link_XXX.hpp, Just include this header, you don't need set any "Linker Input"(library Dependency) on visual studio library. And name-style like boost auto_link.hpp

build setting:

as possible as enable function. UNICODE /Zi debug info vc11up2 MT, MTd, MD, MDd
