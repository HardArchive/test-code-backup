解决windows下服务器退出时，IOCP阻塞问题，实现IOCPMonitor虚函数，解决

bool IOCPMonitor::Stop()
{
#ifdef WIN32
 memset( &m_stopOverlapped.m_overlapped, 0, sizeof(OVERLAPPED) );
 m_stopOverlapped.m_wsaBuffer.buf = NULL;
 m_stopOverlapped.m_wsaBuffer.len = 0;
 m_stopOverlapped.m_overlapped.Internal = 0;
 m_stopOverlapped.sock = 0;
 m_stopOverlapped.completiontype = IOCPMonitor::close;
 
 ::PostQueuedCompletionStatus(m_hCompletPort, 0, 0, (OVERLAPPED*)&m_stopOverlapped );
#endif
 return true;

}
