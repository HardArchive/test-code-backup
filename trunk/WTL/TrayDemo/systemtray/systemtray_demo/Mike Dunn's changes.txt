Changes to the sample project:

CMainFrame::OnCreate()
CMainFrame - Added handlers for Tray menu items.
stdafx.h
SystemTray.cpp/h - I marked my changes/additions with "(md)".
SystemDrayDemo.cpp - I let the frame get displayed so you can use the new Tray
  menu.
BalloonDlg.cpp/h - A dialog used by the Tray/Show Balloon command.


The new methods in CSystemTray are:

CSystemTray() - Added parameters for the balloon tooltip.
CreateEx() - Like Create() but has extra parameters for the balloon tooltip.
  On NT 4 and 9x, it just calls Create().
ShowBalloon() - Pops up a balloon tooltip over the tray icon (Win 2K only).
HideIcon() - On Win 2K, the icon is hidden (using the API) instead of deleted.
ShowIcon() - On Win 2K, the icon is unhidden.  It will reappear in the position
  it was in prior to the HideIcon().
HideIcon() and ShowIcon() have a BOOL parameter that's used only by
  MoveToRight() to force the icon to be deleted and re-added on Win 2K.  This
  parameter shouldn't be formally documented, since the caller should still
  call just "HideIcon()" and "ShowIcon()".


Bug fixes in CSystemTray:

I added a few AfxIsValidString() calls to validate LPCTSTR parameters.
I also used lstrcpyn() to copy strings into the NOTIFYICONDATA
struct to guard against overrunning the char arrays.
