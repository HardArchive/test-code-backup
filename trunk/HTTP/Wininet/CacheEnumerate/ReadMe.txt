USAGE
=====
This sample includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET project files. To create CacheEnumerate.exe,
load CacheEnumerate.sln and build the project.

To build the sample using the command prompt:
=============================================
     1. Open the Command Prompt window and navigate to the  directory.
     2. Type msbuild CacheEnumerate.sln.


To build the sample using Visual Studio 2008 (preferred method):
================================================
     1. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the  directory.
     2. Double-click the icon for the .sln (solution) file to open the file in Visual Studio.

To run the sample:
==================
Usage: CacheEnumerate [-?] | [[-a | -c | -h | -k] -d] | [-e <URL>]
    Flag Semantics:
    -a : Enumerate entries in all fixed containers
    -c : Enumerate entries in the content container
    -d : Delete entries option
    -e : Get details of a entry for a specific URL
    -h : Enumerate entries in the history container
    -k : Enumerate entries in the cookie container
    -? : Display usage info.
For example:
     CacheEnumerate.exe -a - Enumerate all entries in all the fixed containers
     CacheEnumerate.exe -e http://www.microsoft.com/ - get detail on an entry associated a URL
     CacheEnumerate.exe -h -d - Enumerate all the entries in the history container and delete each entry found
     CacheEnumerate.exe -a -d - Enumerate all entries in the fixed containers
