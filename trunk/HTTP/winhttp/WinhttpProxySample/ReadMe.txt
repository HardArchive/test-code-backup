SUMMARY
=======
WinHttp application for determining the proxy for a particular URL.
This sample demonstrates the core functionality for querying the proxy settings. 
Additional features may be added by the application/module basing their proxy code from this sample, including but not limited to:
        1) Per URL proxy cache.
        2) Network Change awareness.
        3) Bad Proxy Filter.

 Applications running as a service who have an interactive user to impersonate
 should impersonate the user and then use this sample code to get proxy settings.
 Applications without a user to impersonate should first use 
 WinHttpGetDefaultProxyConfiguration first and if no settings are configured try
 AutoDetection using WinHttpGetProxyForUrl followed by no-proxy if both fail.
