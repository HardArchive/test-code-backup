liboauth is a collection of c functions implementing the http://oauth.net API.

liboauth provides functions to escape and encode stings according to
OAuth specifications and offers high-level functionality built on top to sign
requests or verify signatures using either NSS or OpenSSL for calculating
the hash/signatures.

The included documentation in the doc/ folder and example code from tests/ 
can also be found online at http://liboauth.sourceforge.net/

 == Test and Example Code ==

After compilation `make check` can be used to perform a off-line self-test.

There is also example code to perform and verify OAuth requests online,
but they are not run automatically.


 tests/oauthexample.c  - CONNECTS TO INTERNET
     walk-though http://term.ie/oauth/example

 tests/oauthtest.c     - CONNECTS TO INTERNET
     gets a request-token from http://term.ie test-server
   
 tests/oauthtest2.c    - CONNECTS TO INTERNET
     gets a request-token from http://term.ie test-server
     using OAuth HTTP Authorization header:
