Robin Gareus <robin@gareus.org> has written and is maintaining liboauth.

The base64 code is used with permission from Jan-Henrik 
Haukeland <hauk@tildeslash.com>.

escape_url() contains code from curl by Daniel Stenberg <daniel@haxx.se>

cheers to Arjan <arjan@scherpenisse.net> for using and testing this code; and 
Ralph Meijer <ralphm@ik.nu> for fixing the debian package and quality control.

Kudos to Marc Worrel - http://www.marcworrell.com/ - for an introduction
to the OAuth API and helping to get this project alive. And last but not 
standing ovations to the http://oauth.net team who made it possible in i
the first place.

Marc Powell suggested minor changes and contributed patches to make this 
library more usable.

Stephen Paul Weber <singpolyma@singpolyma.net> sent patches for the 
initial Debian package.

Dave Gamble <davegamble@gmail.com> has jumped on board. Writing a lightweight
c-api for soundcloud, he sent fixes for windows MSVC support and added the
oauth_curl_post_data_with_callback() function.

Emil A Eklund provided a patch for CURLOPT_TIMEOUT to avoid problems with 
HTTP timeouts.

Many thanks to Diego Elio Petten√≤ who sent patches for the build-system and
packages liboauth for Gentoo. Likewise Tom Parker for Debian, as well as 
Paul Wise who metorered Bilal Akhtar on debian-mentors. All of which provided
valuable feedback.

Last but not least, Jeff Squyres inspired the '-Wl,--as-needed' linker flags
check.
