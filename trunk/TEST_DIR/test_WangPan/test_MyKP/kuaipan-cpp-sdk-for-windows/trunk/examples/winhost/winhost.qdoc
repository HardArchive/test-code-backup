    \title Qt Application using Win32 Windows

    This examples shows how to use the QWinHost class to use a native Win32
    window inside a Qt based user interface.

    \quotefromfile winhost/main.cpp
    \skipto class HostWindow

    \printto signals:
    The HostWindow class is a subclass of QWinHost and reimplements the
    virtual function QWinHost::createWindow() to register a Win32 window 
    class using the RegisterClassEx API, and to create a window using the 
    CreateWindow API. Note that the UNICODE version of all Win32 APIs is
    used.

    \printto protected:
    The class implements a signal \c message to report status changes.

    \printto if (window) switch
    The static \c WndProc function implements the message handling of the
    Win32 window. Since the method is static we have to use QWidget::find()
    to get the QWidget object for the window handle. Since we want to use
    the signal of the HostWindow class, which is the parent window of the
    native Win32 window, we have to cast the QWidget pointer to HostWindow,
    which is safe when using qobject_cast().

    \printuntil };
    The message is then handled in the switch statement. Unhandled messages 
    are passed on to the default window procedure.

    \printuntil }
    The \c main function creates a standard Qt user interface using 
    QMainWindow. The main window's central widget contains a
    QLineEdit as well as the HostWindow. Messages sent by the HostWindow
    object are displayed in the main window's default statusbar.
