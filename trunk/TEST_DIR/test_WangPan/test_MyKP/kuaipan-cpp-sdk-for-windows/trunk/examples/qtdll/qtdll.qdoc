    \title Qt based Application Extension

    This examples shows how to use the QWinWidget and QMfcApp classes to
    implement a Qt based user interface in a plugin DLL.

    \quotefromfile qtdll/main.cpp
    The plugin implements and exports a \c C function \c showDialog that 
    can be called by any Windows application to display a modal Qt dialog.
    Before a Qt based user interface can be created a QApplication object
    must exist, and the calling application's event loop and the Qt event 
    loop must run together.

    \printto extern "C"
    The DLL entry point function \c DllMain uses the QMfcApp::pluginInstance
    function to make sure that exactly one instance of QApplication exists
    in the process, and that the DLL owning that instance stays loaded in 
    memory.

    \printuntil }
    The \c C function \c showDialog is exported from the DLL and uses the
    QWinWidget class to provide proper stacking and modality between the
    native Win32 window and the QMessageBox.
