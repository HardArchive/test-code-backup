This is the SQLiteTbl test application.  It is a dialog-based MFC app.

You will need Visual Studio 2005, or Visual C++ 6.0.

With VS2005:
1) Select File->Open->Project/Solution, and select the "SQLite Test.sln" file.

With VC6.0:
1) Select File->Open->Workspace, and select the "SQLite Test.dsw" file.

2) In the Solution view, select "SQLite-lib" project, and build it.
3) In the Solution view, select "SQLite Test" project, and build it.
4) Run SQLite Test, and Open the file cars.sqlite.


You will need the sqlite library in the sqlite-lib folder.  This is 
where the build will look for the include files and .lib.  You can download
the latest version of SQLite from www.sqilte.org
