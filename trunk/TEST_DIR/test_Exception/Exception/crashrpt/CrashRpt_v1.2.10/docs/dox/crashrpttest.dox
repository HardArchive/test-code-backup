\page demos Running Demo Applications 

\note CrashRpt distribution archive contains compiled demo applications for demonstration purposes. 
If you run the compiled demos from \c bin folder and do not compile them yourself, you might
experience some problems if Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable files are not installed on your machine. 
There may be error messages like 'The application configuration is incorrect' and so on.
If you do not have Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable on your machine and do not want to install it, 
please compile the solution yourself as described in \ref compiling_crashrpt.
